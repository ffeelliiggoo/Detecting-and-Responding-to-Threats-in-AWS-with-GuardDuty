# Project Introduction: Threat Detection with GuardDuty

## About This Project

This documentation represents my work on the "Threat Detection with GuardDuty" challenge from [NextWork.org](https://learn.nextwork.org/projects/aws-security-guardduty). While the original challenge was completed in approximately 2 hours, I've expanded upon the basic framework to provide a more comprehensive analysis of security concepts and additional research.

## Methodology

My approach to this project followed these steps:

1. **Initial Completion**: I worked through the hands-on AWS GuardDuty challenge as outlined in the original project guide.

2. **Content Export**: After completing the challenge, I exported the markdown documentation of the process.

3. **Enhancement Process**: I expanded the documentation in VS Code using the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced)) to better visualize changes while editing.

4. **Content Expansion**: I added deeper technical explanations, security research references, and personal insights throughout the documentation.

## Documentation Structure

This enhanced documentation is organized to provide:

- Clear explanation of each phase of the GuardDuty implementation
- Technical details of the security mechanisms involved
- Expanded research on AWS security best practices
- Personal notes on implementation challenges and solutions
- Practical applications of GuardDuty for threat detection

## Tools Used

- **AWS Console**: For implementing the GuardDuty service
- **VS Code**: Primary editor for documentation
- **Markdown Preview Enhanced extension**: For real-time visualization of markdown formatting
- **NextWork Challenge Framework**: As the foundation for the project steps

The following sections detail my implementation process, findings, and security insights gained through this hands-on experience with AWS GuardDuty.
